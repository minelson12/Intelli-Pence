coin005,CoinVC1fBackgroundRemoved.png,The 150th Anniversary of the Institution of the Victoria Cross,png,Historical Event;Cultural Contribution,"Depicts the anniversary of the creation of the Victoria Cross. The VC is the highest decoration in the British military awards system. It was first introduced in 1856 by Queen Victoria for heroic acts in the Crimean War. The first recipient was Charles Davis Lucas on June 26, 1857, and the most recent recipient was Joshua Leakey in 2013. This award was groundbreaking, as it was created in part to keep pace with other European countries that gave awards regardless of social class or rank. This award was created to honor acts of gallantry, irrespective of length or merit of service. More than a century and a half after its creation it remains significant, representing true patriotism.
