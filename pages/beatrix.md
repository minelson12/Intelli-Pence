I currently have 6/15 of these coins, and they are pictured below. Peter Rabbit, Potter's most well-known and beloved character, is featured five separate times, and as part of Beatrix Potter's birthday coin. The collection features well-known characters in Peter Rabbit's universe. 

In 2016, the Royal Mint released the first five coins in this colleciton to mark Potter's 150th birthday. 
In 2017, the Royal Mint released another four coins, and in 2018 another four. 
In 2020, the final two coins in the collection were released for purchase only, and were uncirculated. 

The rarest of these circulated 50ps are the 2018 Peter Rabbit and Flopsy Bunny, each only having a mintage of 1,400,000. 

Peter Rabbit also appears on special uncirculated Â£5 coins and 1oz Gold Coins for purchase from the Royal Mint.
