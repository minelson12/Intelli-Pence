## About the Collection

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), and depicts a project that showcases my collection of British 50p coins. It includes digitized scanned images at 1200dpi of my physical coins, ranging in mint from 1997 to 2020. It is intended to aid me when I am travelling in the UK and on the hunt for more 50p coins. It would allow me to see which coins I alredy have in my collection and their physical condition, in case I come across one of the same design, but in better condition. It could also be used as a sample on tracking a coin's progress through a population or location. It is especially interesting to note that two of my coins are not actually UK legal tender, but somehow made their way into my position throughout my time in the UK, mainly spent in St Andrews, Edinburgh and London. They come from the Isle of Man and the Channel Island, which are Crown Dependencies with their own currency.

## About the Platform

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents
